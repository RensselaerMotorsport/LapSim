how large are yaw effects?
- do fsae cars slip laterally?
-> guess is no

therefore
lat g's all contribute to changing direction
lon g's all contribute to changing speed
- traction at rear tires
-> minus traction contributing to lateral accel

differential affects yaw affects, and exit accels, but not by much
how do dampers, anti-roll bars, springs, etc. all affect lat accel?
- only important in transient
how does steering position, ackerman, SA, SR, all affect lat accel?
- only important in transient


other conclusions:
yaw effects are only important for unstable cars
- design for stability, simulate assuming stability
-> becomes much more important for hub motors
do not include transient calcs
do not include suspension
point mass - single traction circle
bicicle - two traction circles added with long load transfer
track - four traction circles added with long, lat load transfer


DECISION 1
point mass
vs.
bicicyle model
vs.
single track model
	-> start with point mass
	-> go to bicicyle model over time
	-> SINGLE TRACK MODEL

QUESTION 1
can you add friction elipses
or
do you have to take rms

QUESTION 2
how do you model curved path?
- take away required traction, rest goes to accel
- find max speed at next apex
- find max speed at every apex?

DECISION 2
inertias
vs.
efficiency
-> inertia only affects transient accel
-> efficiency is different

QUESTION 3
how do you create tracks?
-> build off of actual testing data (need to use old tracks)



NECESSSARY next steps
- HIL testing
- rigorous testing of all written equations and coefficients

FUTURE additions (DONT DO MOST OF THIS)
- (3%) "driver skill" - predictions for top corner speed
- (0.05%) transient effects - ramp up speed for torque, voltage, electrical systems
- (0.001%) turning speed - time taken to turn the steering wheel
- (0.02%) differential modeling - ramp angles, preload
- (0.1%) wind Force - wind during comp

FAR Reaches (DONT EVER DO THIS)
- implement cfd & fea into model
- automatically spits out optimized sprocket models
- automatically calculates wear on drivetrain
- calculates lifetime of vehicle components (bearings, gearboxes)
- calculates chain stretch
-> determines ideal chain tension
- plot steering angle
