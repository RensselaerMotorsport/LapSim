length step can be determined however you see fit, I picked .1 m
with length step and a very small initial velocity we are able to calculate the velocity at the end of a segment
after exit velocity of segment is found, must find new torque value given the exit speed
use new torque value to find the next segment's engine force
After every segment, must check if exit velocity is greater than the gear shift velocity given our current gear (i.e. if we are in first gear, at 17.3 m/s we must shift to gear 2)
Shift 1-2 is at 17.3 m/s
Shift 2-3 is at 22.6 m/s
Shift 3-4 is at 27 m/s
during gear shift segments, must drop engine force or torque to zero for .3 seconds (gear shift time can be a variable if you would like, depends on driver skill)
This will drop the velocity of a couple segments
after gear shift event is complete, the speed at which we shift to the next gear must be changed
with exit velocity and entrance velocity we can make an estimate of how much time that segment took
time = 1/(((V_initial+V_final) / 2) / length_step)))
With time, exit, and entrance velocity, we can find acceleration:
a= deltaV divided by time
