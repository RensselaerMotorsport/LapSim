List of the physics model's assumptions

Note: This list is a forever living document and as the simulation is refined there will be assumptions added or removed

1. Perfect driver (car always operates at its limits without slipping)
2. Rear and front tire size are equal
3. Lateral acceleration is equal to centripital force (in reality it is equal to centripital force multiplied by the cosine of the sideslip angle)
4. Each turn is of constant radius
5. The car is a point mass rather than a rigid body
6. Neglects suspension effects
7. Tire models do not exist (will change)
8. Tires spin at the same speed (limited slip differential does not exist)
9. All angles are small and thus follow small angle aproximations 
10. RH turns are positive (i.e. lateral acceleration to the left of the vehicle axis is negative, this follows SAE convention)
